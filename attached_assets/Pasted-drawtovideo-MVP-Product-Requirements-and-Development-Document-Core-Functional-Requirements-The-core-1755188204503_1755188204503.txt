drawtovideo MVP Product Requirements and Development Document
Core Functional Requirements

The core of this product is a visual, interactive video generation system. Instead of relying solely on textual prompts, users can draw and annotate directly on an initial image (the first frame) to guide the AI in generating a video
help.scenario.com
. The MVP will focus on the following key interactive features:

Arrow-based motion paths: Users can draw arrows on the image to indicate the direction and path along which an object or subject should move. The AI interprets these arrows as motion guides, moving elements in the video along the sketched trajectory
help.scenario.com
higgsfield.ai
.

Bounding-box object locking: By drawing a bounding box around a specific object or region in the image, the user essentially “locks” that as the target of an animation or effect. This ensures the AI knows exactly which part of the scene to animate or transform according to the instructions
higgsfield.ai
.

On-image text cues (mood & context): Users can write brief text directly on the image to describe actions or desired emotions/atmosphere. These text annotations (for example, labeling a sky with "angry sky" or adding "zoom in" next to a camera icon) provide additional context and nuance, such as overall mood, style, or camera hints
help.scenario.com
. The AI uses this info to refine the output (e.g., setting an emotional tone or lighting style), and those written cues are then removed from the final video frames automatically.

Sequenced actions: The tool supports numbering multiple instructions (e.g., “1”, “2”, “3”) to define a specific sequence of events for more complex animations
higgsfield.ai
. With these ordered labels, users can create a simple storyboard of actions – for instance, "1: man walks", "2: car drives by", "3: explosion happens", each corresponding to drawings on the image. (It’s recommended to keep sequences to a few key actions to ensure consistency and clarity in the generated video.)

By combining these visual and textual inputs, the system can effectively “understand” the user’s intent in a more intuitive way, and generate the video accordingly. This spatial prompting approach bridges the gap between human visual thinking and the AI’s interpretation, allowing creators to communicate in the native visual language (sketches and arrows) instead of having to translate ideas into complicated text descriptions and back into visuals
help.scenario.com
. The result is a generation process that is far more predictable and controllable, giving users confidence that the output will match their vision.

User Pain Points & Our Solutions

Greater controllability (no more guesswork): With traditional text-to-video, users often feel like they’re dealing with a “black box,” guessing prompts and hoping for the best. Misinterpretations and random outcomes are common. Our draw-to-video approach addresses this by prioritizing direct control – users literally draw out what they want to happen, so the results align much more closely with their expectations
help.scenario.com
. This WYSIWYG style guidance means no more cryptic prompt engineering; the AI follows clear, visual directives, eliminating the guesswork from the creative process.

Avoiding "blind box" failures: Many current tools can feel like opening a blind box – you input a prompt and you’re never sure what you’ll get, often leading to frustration after multiple failed tries. By letting users guide the AI with concrete visuals, our product removes the randomness from the equation. As one industry commentary noted, creators can “skip the frustration of prompt crafting and [jump] straight into pure creation”
higgsfield.ai
. In practice, this means far fewer disappointing, off-mark results. Users see what they’re asking for (via sketches and notes) so the output is much more likely to be on target – no luck required.

High-definition output: A common pain point with current AI video generators is low resolution outputs (many are capped around 480p–720p). Users often need to run extra upscaling tools to get HD quality
reddit.com
. We aim to solve this by making 1080p HD video output support a priority in our MVP. From the start, users should be able to obtain videos with crisp details and clarity suitable for real use, without needing additional enhancement steps. By delivering higher resolution results than typical, we meet professional creators’ quality needs and set ourselves apart from tools that output grainy or low-res clips.

Longer video clips: Today’s text-to-video models tend to generate only very short clips by default (often about 4–5 seconds per clip)
pikalabs.org
. If users want a longer scene, they have to manually chain together multiple outputs or use workaround techniques (like re-feeding the last frame to continue, which is cumbersome)
reddit.com
. Our product addresses this by supporting longer durations per generation. Even in the MVP, we plan for the tool to generate, say, ~10 second clips (or more) in one go. This gives users more narrative freedom within a single output. They can create a more complete scene or story beat without the tedious process of stitching clips. It directly tackles creators’ desire for more sustained content and sets us apart from competitors stuck at the 4-second norm.

Reliability and consistency: The combination of visual guidance with textual context not only makes results more accurate to the prompt, but also more consistent between runs. Users shouldn’t have to retry something five times to get a usable video. By reducing ambiguity in what the AI should do, our approach yields reliable outputs and a more forgiving user experience for newcomers. This translates into a higher success rate for each generation, mitigating the feeling of “wasting credits” or time on failed attempts that many currently experience.

MVP Scope – Focusing on the Core

To deliver the most value quickly, the MVP will be tightly scoped around the core draw-to-video functionality, deliberately omitting secondary features that are not essential to the primary experience:

Single-scene generation: The MVP supports one scene (one continuous video clip) at a time. The user will upload or create a single image as the starting frame and generate a video from that. We are not building multi-scene editing or a complex timeline into the MVP. This keeps the process simple: one image in, one video out. By focusing on one scene per generation, we reduce complexity and increase reliability – it aligns with best practices that suggest handling one transformation at a time for more stable results
help.scenario.com
. Users who need multi-scene stories can still create them by stringing results manually, but the MVP itself will concentrate on excelling at the single scene level.

No advanced post-processing or editing pipeline: We will avoid introducing heavy video editing features or iterative refinement steps in the MVP. The user flow will be straightforward – provide inputs (drawing and text) and get a video. We won’t include things like manual in-painting of frames, re-generating specific segments, or complex model switches. By not adding these advanced modification logics, we ensure the core generation pipeline remains fast and robust. There are fewer moving parts that can break, and the development can focus on optimizing the primary generation quality. This choice also simplifies the UI for users: there are minimal knobs and levers, which lowers the learning curve.

Minimalist feature set to maximize the “wow” factor: The MVP will contain only the most compelling, must-have modules that showcase the product’s unique value. We intentionally leave out non-core extras. For example, capabilities like background music/sound generation, lip-sync for characters, or style filters will not be part of MVP, as they are peripheral to the main draw-to-video interaction. Omitting these initially avoids over-complicating the user experience and keeps the focus on our differentiator. This aligns with advice to limit the scope of each generation or transformation for best performance
higgsfield.ai
 – likewise, we limit the scope of the product to ensure the primary feature shines without distraction.

Build on core success before expanding: This lean approach allows us to validate the core concept with users as early as possible. We’ll launch with the essential draw-and-generate functionality and gather feedback. If the core feature resonates (users love playing with it and it solves their needs), then we can confidently invest in additional features (like multi-scene editing, audio, longer durations, etc.) in future iterations. Essentially, the MVP strategy is to nail the fundamentals first – prove that “draw to video” is indeed something users find valuable and delightful – and only then gradually broaden the product offering. This ensures we don’t over-engineer upfront and that subsequent development is guided by actual user priorities.

Homepage Structure Recommendations

To attract users and rank well on search engines, the website’s homepage should be strategically structured. It needs to immediately convey what the product is, entice visitors to try it (the “see and want to play” effect), and also include enough relevant content for SEO. Here’s a breakdown of the recommended sections and content:

Clear hero message with call-to-action: At the top of the homepage, have a concise headline that explicitly includes the “draw to video” concept and highlights our value proposition. For example, a title like “Draw to Video: Turn Your Sketches into Animated Videos” instantly tells a new visitor what we do. (This also places our main keywords right in the most prominent heading for SEO
drawtovideo.co
.) A supporting subtitle can drive the point home, e.g., “An AI tool that brings doodles to life – no editing skills needed.” Alongside this text, a strong CTA button (e.g., “Try It Now”) should be clearly visible to invite immediate action. The goal is that within seconds of landing, the user understands the product and has a one-click path to start using it.

Engaging product demo (visual proof): Right below the hero section, show an example of our tool in action. This could be a side-by-side comparison of an input drawing and a short clip of the resulting video, or a short looping video generated by our tool displayed prominently. For instance, we might show a rough stick-figure drawing of a person and next to it the AI-generated video of that person moving. This gives users a “wow” moment and reinforces the urge to try it themselves. Competitors often showcase multiple example animations on their front pages for exactly this reason
drawtovideo.co
. We should include a few eye-catching examples with brief captions (e.g., “Hand-drawn arrow ➜ Flying rocket animation”), which not only demonstrate capabilities but also naturally incorporate keywords and descriptive text that benefit SEO.

Key features highlight: Following the demo, present a section that distills our core features/benefits into bite-sized points. This can be done with icons and short headings, each with one sentence of explanation. Focus on the things that make our product shine: for example “Interactive Drawing Interface – Directly control motion with arrows”, “Object Locking – Target exactly what you want to animate”, “Text Prompts for Style – Add emotion or camera cues”, “HD Output – Get high-res results” and so on. Each point should emphasize how it helps the user (e.g., “no more random outcomes” or “cinematic quality videos”). This section not only educates users on the product’s advantages but also allows us to embed important keywords in a natural way (like “AI video generation,” “sketch animation”)
drawtovideo.co
drawtovideo.co
. It should be formatted for easy scanning, since many visitors will just skim these highlights.

How it works – 1-2-3 steps: Include a simplified walkthrough of using the tool, to reassure users that it’s easy and quick. This could be presented as three steps with small illustrations: 1) “Upload or draw your image” (maybe an icon of an upload or a pencil), 2) “Draw arrows & add a note” (icon of an arrow or edit symbol), 3) “Generate your video” (a play icon or film strip). Beneath each, a short description explains what’s happening. For example: “Upload a picture or use our canvas to sketch the starting scene,” then “Draw arrows to animate, add text like ‘spin’ or ‘zoom’ for extra guidance,” then “Click Generate to watch your drawing come alive as a video.” This step-by-step section serves two purposes: it mentally prepares users that “okay, I can do this, it’s not complicated,” and it provides another chance to slip in key phrases (like “AI generates video in seconds” or “sketch to animation in one click”) which can help with search relevance.

SEO-friendly explanatory text: We should dedicate a portion of the homepage to a more detailed description of the product, written in full sentences/paragraphs, not just bullets. This is important for SEO because it gives search engines rich content to index about what our tool is and does. A good approach is to have a brief “What is Draw-to-Video?” section or an intro blurb. For instance: “Draw-to-Video is an advanced AI platform that transforms your drawings into animated videos. Simply sketch or upload an image, annotate it with arrows and text, and let the AI generate a high-quality video for you
drawtovideo.io
.…” etc. We should mention the uniqueness (interactive drawing control) and the main features in a narrative form. Competitor sites often include such explanatory text or even an FAQ on the homepage because it helps answer user questions and improves SEO
drawtovideo.co
. We must ensure our version is well-written and naturally includes our target keywords (like “AI video generator from drawings,” “sketch-to-video tool,” etc.). This content is primarily for SEO and those who scroll to learn more, while not getting in the way of users who are ready to click “try now.”

Example gallery & use cases: Further down, we can showcase a gallery of example outputs organized by category or use case. For example, a grid of thumbnail videos or a slider could show: “Product Demo Video – 15 seconds – (prompt: a hand-drawn phone that turns into a spinning 3D phone model)”, “Educational Video – 10 seconds – (prompt: a stick figure teacher diagram that animates)”, “Creative Art – 8 seconds – (prompt: abstract doodle morphing into artwork)”, etc. Each example would have a short title and description
drawtovideo.co
drawtovideo.co
, which again is an opportunity to include descriptive text and varied keywords. This section serves to inspire potential users (by demonstrating versatility) and to capture long-tail search queries (someone searching for “AI tool for making marketing video from drawing” might find our example). We could also label some use-case categories explicitly (like “Marketing”, “Education”, “Entertainment”) to appeal to those segments and improve relevancy for those terms
drawtovideo.co
. It’s important, however, to keep sample videos file sizes small or use optimized GIFs so that the page remains fast.

Social proof (testimonials or stats): To further build trust, the homepage should include a social proof element. This could be a testimonial slider with quotes from beta users or industry experts. For example: “‘DrawtoVideo dramatically improved our content creation speed – we went from idea to video in minutes. Unbelievable!’ – Jane D., YouTube Creator”. Having a name, picture, and title where possible adds authenticity. Alternatively or additionally, we could display some key usage statistics: e.g., “10,000+ videos generated”, “5,000 creators have tried DrawtoVideo”, or logos of notable companies/platforms that have featured or used us (if applicable). On one competitor’s site, they highlight numbers like daily videos created and even claim “free forever” as a draw
drawtovideo.co
. In our case, if we have any such data by launch, it’s great to include. Social proof helps users feel this is a tried-and-true solution, not an untested gimmick.

Footer with FAQ and full navigation: At the bottom of the homepage, we should have a footer that provides two things: a mini FAQ and the site’s navigation links. The FAQ can address 2-3 of the most pressing questions a user might have after reading the page. Common ones could be “Is it free to use?” (to which we answer the specifics of our free tier or beta), “What are the video limits?” (we can mention resolution and length currently supported), or “Do I need to sign up?” etc. Providing these answers right on the homepage can reassure users and also naturally include more keywords and clarity about our offering
drawtovideo.co
drawtovideo.co
. As for navigation, ensure links to deeper pages like Features, Pricing, Documentation/Help, and Contact (and possibly a link to switch language between EN/中文) are present. The footer is also a good place to reiterate our product name and a short tagline, as well as copyright info. We might also include links to our social media or community (Discord, etc.) if relevant. A well-structured footer helps both users (easy to find info) and SEO (every page gets these important links for crawlability, plus it signals a complete site).

In summary, the homepage should be designed to guide a visitor through a story: What is this? How does it help me? Can I trust it? Okay, I’ll try it. All while embedding the critical keywords “draw to video”, “AI video generator”, “sketch animation” and similar terms in a natural, user-friendly way. A clear structure as outlined above will not only impress human visitors but also signal to Google that our site is highly relevant to queries around AI video generation, giving us a shot at those top rankings.

Domain Name & Product Naming Suggestions

Choosing a good name is crucial for branding and SEO. We want something that is memorable, directly relevant to our function, and ideally with an available domain (preferably .com). Below are some suggestions along with reasoning:

Draw2Video / DrawToVideo: This name is as straightforward as it gets – it literally describes the core functionality: drawing to generate video. The clarity is great for marketing and SEO; anyone seeing the name immediately knows what to expect. “DrawToVideo” as a phrase matches the keyword users might search. Since some variation of this name is already in use (for example, there are sites on .io, .co domains), one idea is to use the version with the number “2” – Draw2Video – which reads well and could have an available .com domain. It’s short, descriptive, and easy to remember. The downside is it’s not very brandable or unique (it’s more of a descriptive name than a coined brand word), but given our focus on SEO and clear messaging, this could be a strong choice if we can secure a good domain.

SketchToVideo: Similar to above, but using the word “Sketch” which might appeal to artists or imply a more creative angle. It conveys the same idea of turning drawings into video. A domain like SketchToVideo.com or .ai could work. This name is slightly longer but uses common words. It’s very explicit in meaning, which is good. SEO-wise, “sketch to video” is a likely search phrase for people specifically wanting to animate sketches. One thing to consider is whether “sketch” might limit perception (some might think it only works for pencil-style sketches, whereas “draw” is more general). However, it’s a solid descriptive name and easy to understand globally.

DoodleVid: A shorter, catchier option by combining “Doodle” (which implies fun, casual drawing) with “Vid” (short for video). DoodleVid.com is playful and evokes the idea of doodles coming to life as videos. This name leans more into the fun aspect (“that looks fun, let me try doodling something!”) in line with the “see and want to play” goal. It’s also quite short. The trade-off is that it’s a bit less obvious at first glance than the “X to Video” names, but still close (doodle video). With a tagline, it could work well (e.g., “DoodleVid – draw it, watch it move”). It’s unique, which helps with brandability. We’d need to ensure people associate it with our concept whenever they see it – which strong marketing can achieve.

MotionSketch: This name puts an emphasis on the result (motion) and the input (sketch). It suggests an artistic tool that infuses motion into sketches. MotionSketch.com (if available) has a professional ring and is quite straightforward about what it does. It’s moderately easy to say and remember. As a coined term, it’s unique but still understandable. It also might appeal to a slightly more professional audience (designers, animators) because it sounds like something they might use. From an SEO perspective, it contains “sketch” and “motion” which are relevant, though people might not search that exact term initially. It’s more of a brandable descriptive hybrid.

AniDraw: A blend of “Animate” and “Draw,” which succinctly captures the concept. AniDraw.com is very short and snappy. It’s a bit more abstract (someone might need to think “Ani is like animate?”) but it’s catchy and has a nice ring. This kind of name is highly brandable, and we can imbue it with meaning through our marketing. It doesn’t include the word “video,” but it implicitly suggests drawing animations. If we go with a name like this, we’d definitely include a tagline on the site for clarity, like “AniDraw – Draw to Animate Video” or similar, to immediately connect the dots for new visitors and search engines. The benefit here is uniqueness – an invented name means easier trademarking and distinguishing from competitors.

Additional considerations: We should check domain availability for our top choices early on. A .com is ideal for credibility and SEO, but a .ai or .io could be acceptable if we heavily target tech-savvy users – though note that our target includes mainstream users, so .com is still preferable if possible. Also consider how the name might be abbreviated or used in conversation (for example, “I used DrawToVideo to make this” vs “I used DoodleVid”). We want something that’s not awkward to say. International factors: since we will have a Chinese version as well, the name should be easy to transliterate or at least not carry negative meanings. The ones above are pretty safe in that regard. We could also come up with a short Chinese nickname for community use (perhaps something like “画影” which means “drawn video”), but the official product name would remain in English. Overall, each of the suggested names above aligns with the product’s theme – the final decision will balance how descriptive vs. brandable we want the name to be.

Competitive Differentiation Highlights

We have several competitors or analogous products in the AI video generation space. Here we outline how our product will differentiate itself, particularly against Pika Labs, Runway Gen-2, and Higgsfield’s draw-to-video feature, as those are key points of reference:

Compared to Pika Labs: Pika Labs is an AI video generator that primarily operates via text prompts (originally on Discord). It’s known for producing short (~4 second) videos with impressive image quality. Recently, Pika added some “camera control” features in its 1.0 update, allowing basic text commands for camera movements
nofilmschool.com
. However, control in Pika is still through typing special instructions, which can be limiting and non-intuitive. Our tool is fundamentally different in that it offers visual control – you draw the motion you want. This direct manipulation is far more intuitive than guessing the right words or using preset motions. Also, Pika’s content length is limited; clips are very short unless you manually chain them, and the platform itself is geared toward those short bursts
pikalabs.org
. In contrast, our MVP targets a longer default duration per clip (addressing the need for more content in one go). Accessibility is another differentiator: Pika has been tied to Discord and requires sign-up, and its free usage is constrained, whereas we plan to allow users to jump in on our web app without even logging in, at least for a trial. The bottom line: we turn the “prompt guessing game” into a playful drawing activity, giving more control to the user and delivering longer videos out-of-the-box.

Compared to Runway Gen-2: Runway’s Gen-2 (and now Gen-3/4) is at the cutting edge of text-to-video AI, and they introduced a Director Mode with custom camera movements to improve controllability
nofilmschool.com
. That said, Runway’s interface for control is still largely forms and sliders or very short text commands, not drawing. Our approach is more immediate – instead of describing a camera pan in words or selecting it from a dropdown, you literally draw an arrow to indicate a pan or object motion. This can dramatically lower the barrier for users to get the result they want. On output quality, Runway is known for higher fidelity and has been used in professional contexts, but that often comes with high variability; some users report inconsistent or “weird” outputs despite many prompt tweaks
reddit.com
. Our visual guidance aims to make outputs more consistently aligned with user intent, reducing those unpredictable artifacts. Another aspect is complexity: Runway as a platform offers a full suite of video editing and VFX tools along with generative features, which is powerful but can overwhelm new users. We are deliberately stripping away complexity in our MVP – it does one thing (turn drawings into videos) extremely easily. This means a newcomer can have success on the first try, as opposed to possibly being lost in the myriad of options in Runway. Lastly, regarding length and speed: Runway’s base generation was ~4-5 seconds, and while they’ve introduced methods to extend clips to ~18 seconds or more, it’s a multi-step process for the user
help.runwayml.com
city-data.com
. We treat generating a longer clip as a one-step, built-in capability, which will be a relief for users who don’t want to fuss with multiple operations to get a 10-second video. In summary, we position against Runway by offering ease-of-use and precise control at the cost of maybe some advanced bells and whistles – a trade-off we believe many users (especially non-professionals) will happily accept.

Compared to Higgsfield (Draw-to-Video): Higgsfield.ai’s “Draw-to-Video” feature is the closest parallel to what we’re building – it validates that our core idea is technically feasible and in demand. Higgsfield similarly lets users sketch arrows and minimal text to direct video generation, branding itself with slogans like “the prompt era is over – now you can just direct”
higgsfield.ai
. Our key differentiators here will be focus and approachability. Higgsfield is a sophisticated platform with multiple AI models (MiniMax, Veo 3, Seedance, etc.) and many options for users to tweak
higgsfield.ai
. That can be powerful for experts, but for an average user it adds friction (for example, picking which model to use for a particular video is not trivial). Our product will likely use one well-rounded model behind the scenes (or auto-select one), so the user doesn’t have to make that decision – they can concentrate on the creative part without worrying about technical details. Another difference is how we’ll handle free usage and onboarding. Higgsfield currently has a limited free tier (e.g., 2 videos per month, ~5 seconds each on the free plan)
reddit.com
 and then requires payment. For someone just curious to try “drawing a video,” that limit might be a deterrent. We plan to be more generous or at least more open in the early stages to attract users – possibly free unlimited short tries or a much larger quota – to lower the barrier for adoption. Also, Higgsfield’s branding skews towards a professional, film-maker tone (“AI-cinema”, “director’s era”), whereas we aim to appeal to a broader creative audience, including educators, designers, content creators, and even hobbyists who might just want to play with a new toy. We’ll differentiate in marketing by being more inclusive and fun-oriented, not just targeting filmmakers. In essence, while the underlying tech concept is similar, we want our implementation to be seen as more user-friendly and accessible, where Higgsfield’s might be viewed as more advanced but also more complex. This differentiation will help us carve out our own user base.

Other competitors and landscape: There are other notable mentions in the AI video space – for example, tools like Pixverse which introduced a “Magic Brush” for animating specific parts of an image by drawing arrows
journeyaiart.com
, or general platforms like Meta’s Make-A-Video, Krikey.ai, etc. Many are exploring ways to give users more control, whether via reference videos, depth maps, or simple drawing interfaces. The trend is clear: the future of generative video is more controllable and interactive. Our strategy is to ride at the forefront of this wave by focusing specifically on the draw-to-animate niche and doing it better than anyone else. We take inspiration from these tools (e.g., confirming that arrow-drawing for motion is something users find valuable) but we aim to stand out through simplicity and reliability. By narrowing our feature set, we can polish the experience to be delightful (whereas a broader tool might only half-solve the control problem). Moreover, by optimizing our site and content around the “draw to video” theme, we intend to dominate SEO for that keyword and related searches. If we execute right, when people think “I wish I could just draw what I want in a video,” our product will be the one they discover first and remember.

In summary, we leverage what we’ve learned from these competitors: Pika showed that generative video can be popular but suffers from lack of control; Runway showed the appetite for quality but highlights the complexity issue; Higgsfield proved the effectiveness of sketch-based prompting but caters to a pro audience. Our product will combine the strengths of these approaches while eliminating pain points – delivering an easy, fun, and powerful “draw to video” experience that precisely targets users’ core needs in this space. By doing so, we aim not only to compete but to become the preferred tool for anyone interested in turning drawings into videos.
